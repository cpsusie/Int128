**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Provide the operation that performed incorrectly.  (e.g: uint128_t y = 1_u128 + 1_u128).
2. Provide the expected result (e.g.: y == 2_u128)
3. Provide the actual result (e.g. y == 3_u128)
4. Indicate whether (if known) the incorrect behavior happened at compile time or runtime.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [Windows 10, Kubuntu 20.10, FreeBSD x.y ]

 - Target Architecture (ARM64, Intel/AMD x64, etc)
 - If Windows whether any special calculation modes used (AVX2, BMI2, ADX)
 -  If available, output from running the -environ switch of WinInt128.exe such as:
