# Unit Test Application for CJM Numerics (a fixed precision a fixed precision numeric library for C++20)  
**Copyright Â© 2021, CJM Screws, LLC** 

## Summary  

The unit test application is a command line application that runs a suite of unit tests to demonstrate the correctness of operations on the uint128 type defined in the CJM Numerics library.  The primary focus and goal of the tests is to ensure the correctness of the numerical computations provided by the library at both compile and runtime.  Compile-time correctness is checked during the compilation of the unit test application.  The application needs to be run to apply runtime testing.  
  
A Secondary goal of the unit test application include testing the correctness of to-string conversion and from-string parsing, particularly for std::string and std::wstring (and their matching streams and string_views).  Some experimental support is included for using strings (and streams/string_views) based on char8_t, char16_t and char32_t: these seem to work on Windows, but are iffy on linux setups.  Supporting the newer string types is a tertiary goal of the test application, at best.

Another secondary goal of the unit test application is to provide a way to print out information about the target environment including compiler used, 64 or 32 bit, whether adx and bmi2 are enabled, sizes and alignments of standard numeric types, etc.

As seen, the name and test result of each run test will be logged to the standard output.  More detailed results will be written to a text file whose name based on a root of "base_test_batter_results", a timestamp and the .txt extension.  Certain classes of failures (none shown) may be written to the standard error and/or the output file depending on their nature.  

NOTE: the test "hash_dx" takes a very long time (maybe 30 secondsish) on a *debug* build built with Microsoft's compiler.  For release builds, this test takes less than a second on my machine.  Using GCC or Clang in Linux, while a performance difference between *debug* and *release* exists, it is no where near as profound as the difference using Microsoft's compiler.  So, if testing with a debug buld made with Microsoft's compiler, expect it to take a while.  
  
### **USING SWITCHES**  

Besides its default behavior of running the entire battery of tests, the application supports switches to get help, print environmental information, list available tests, run a specific individual test from the list or to execute a unary or binary operation text file.  (Many tests, upon failure, will output a text file with the operation and values that resulted in failure.  You can also make your own fairly easily.)  To enter a switch, prefix its name with -- or - (all operating systems) or (Windows only) /.  For example, to get help, entering the switch --help (or any command line arguments not understood by the application) lists the switches as shown:    

*WINDOWS:*
```dos
E:\Source\Repos\cjm-numerics\uint128_test_app\src\x64\Release>WinInt128.exe brofklor
There was a problem, likely when processing command-line arguments:
        Argument: [brofklor] is not a switch:
        Switches begin with: "-", "--", or (on windows): "/"

Switches include:
        unary_from_file         Execute unary operations tests as specified in unary operations text file.
        binary_from_file        Execute binary operations tests as binary in unary operations text file.
        environ                 Print environmental information.
        default_tests           Run all tests in default battery, logging summary of result to standard output and detail to a log file.
        list                    List all tests in the default battery.
        specific_test           Run the specified test from the default battery.
        help                    Print this information.

#### **unary_from_file switch**  
  
The "unary_from_file_switch" requires as an argument the path of an ASCII text file containing unary operations.  It will then execute the unary operations in the file and report on success or failure.  

An example of such a file can be found [here][1] and is shown below:

> !x;340282366920938463463374607431768211455;  
!x;340282366920938463463374607431768211454;  
~x;0;  
-x;1;  
static_cast<bool>(x);170141183460469231731687303715884105728;  
!x;9223372036854775808;  
+x;18446744073709551615;  
--x;340282366920938463463374607431768211454;  
++x;18446744073709551616;  

The symbols for each supported operation can be found in the [int128_tests.hpp][5] header in the array called [un_op_symbol_lookup][3].  A test is deemed to pass if, when a unary operation of the specified type is applied to a value of type uint128 and an equivalent value of type [`boost::multiprecision::uint128_t`][7] (from the Boost library), the resulting values are equivalent.  If the resulting values differ, the test is deemed to have failed.

```  

#### **binary_from_file switch**  

The "binary_from_file_switch" requires as an argument the path of an ASCII text file containing binary operations.  It will then execute the binary operations in the file and report on success or failure.  

An example of such a file can be found here and is shown (greatly shortened) below:

> /;0;1;  
%;0;1;  
%;14627333968688430831;1611526157;  
/;3235827725;239;

The symbols for each supported operation can be found in the [int128_tests.hpp][5] header in the array called [op_symbol_lookup][6].  A test is deemed to pass if, when a binary operation of the specified type is applied to two values of type uint128 and two equivalent values of type [`boost::multiprecision::uint128_t`][7] (from the Boost library), the resulting values are equivalent.  If the resulting values differ, the test is deemed to have failed.

Enabling AVX2 both allows the compiler to use AVX2 vector extensions on its own and, in certain circumstances, to use compiler intrinsics from ADX and BMI2, which are more efficient than the default intrinsics for those operations.  You are encouraged to enable AVX2 on a Linux platform as well, but the **initial note about ADX and BMI2 in the output will always read false in Linux**: Linux takes advantage of built-in uint128 arithmetic and the library does not use compiler intrinsics on Linux.  You should not take their showing up as false in Linux to mean that GCC or Clang is not using those architectural features ... it merely means that the library is not directly using those intrinsic function to perform calculations.  On Linux, it is left up to the compiler.  The initial notice about ADX and BMI2 is relevant for 64-bit Windows targets only (whether using Microsoft's compiler, the Clang compiler included in Visual Studio by Microsoft, or Intel's LLVM based compiler for Windows).  

The following are the results of executing the application with the environ switch on Linux (Clang 11.0.0-2):

#### default_tests switch

Executing the application with the "default_tests" switch is the same as executing it without specifying any switches: the entire battery of tests is executed.  See above for examples.  

#### list switch 

Executing the application with the list switch provides a list of the individual tests from the battery of tests.  These can be used with the "specific_test" switch (see below) to run individual tests from the battery.  

**Usage Example**:  
  
*WINDOWS:*

#### **specific_test switch**

Using the specific_test switch with the name of a test (as obtained by the list switch, see above) executes the specified test.  When executing an individual test rather than the entire battery, all information is sent to the standard ouput (hopefully) or the standard error (in the sad case).  The following examples demonstrate the hash_dx test.  The hash_dx test generates hashes, and prints out usage information.  In 64-bit environments it is highly unlikely that there will be any equal uint128 values produced and also highly unlikely that any of the hash values obtained from uint128 will collide.  In a 32-bit environment, however, you can expect around 150 hash collisions.

Note that x86 Linux *may* work and (the library itself, not the unit test application) *probably would* work (at least after a few bug fixes) but **x86 Linux has NEVER been tested** and is not, presently, part of the test process applied to this library.

## Test Application Dependencies  

Unlike the library itself and the example code project, which are dependency free, the unit test project relies on several external dependencies.  Those dependencies include:

1. [abseil-C++17][8] (vcpkg: abseil[cxx17])
2. [boost][9] version 1.73+ (vcpkg: boost)
3. [hinnant/date][10] 3.0.0+ (vcpkg: date)  

The visual studio project file for the test application and the CMAKE / CLion project files assume that you are using vcpkg to manage your dependencies.  In Visual Studio, these libraries are built linking against a static CRT (C runtime) for both x64 and x86 Windows and are linked statically into the unit test application (which also links against a static CRT).  On Linux/CLion/CMake, vcpkg default Linux linkage settings (I assume dynamic runtime and dynamic library linkage) are used.   

Abseil and Boost are used to provide control for the applications test cases.  Many take equivalent values of uint128 from this library and boosts uint128_t or abseil's uint128 type and perform identical operations on them.  Tests are deemed passing if the test result matches the boost or abseil control result.  Howard Hinnant's date library (which has been adopted into C++20's standard library but presently not fully supported by GCC, Clang and Microsoft) is used to help generate date-based suffixes for file output. Also, several of Boost's other convenience features are used (such as its output format saver).  

## Binaries For Windows

For Windows, I plan to release the unit test application in binary form with future beta and official releases.  It will be available in Debug and Release builds for both x86 and x64 targets.  The x64 targets will assume AVX2 is available.  If requested, I will create a x64 Windows binary that does not enable AVX2 though most fairly recent processors from AMD and Intel (last 5-7 years or so) support it.  For now, do not attempt to run unit test application binaries built for x64 Windows on a processor too old to support AVX2.
